My goal was to complete a project each month, unfornatuly it did not work out last month. Between moving and general work hecticness I couldn't complete the goal I had set out.
Instead I want to finish the adventure this month, and I am already starting on creating a game for next month. I am also considering focusing on games for now.
With some dungeons in between. The main issue I am running into general "adventures" that a completed adventure is a lot more nebulous. It does not feel really finished.
So in general, I am still alive, and the project is still on. I just had to skip a month!
