Like most people I struggle with finishing projects, I feel a ***need*** to start finishing my creative endeavors. Mostly because I spent a lot of time hopping between different hobbies with *nothing* to show for it. This page will be a reminder for my lack of finished products. I will use it as my startpage, to see how **empty** it is or won't be.
 
To start the project off I am working on making a small dungeon/adventure every month, in the spirit of one-page-dungeons or a zine style adventure.The first should be done by the end of March.
 
I'm also working on a dungeon crawling game, my ambition is to complete it within 3 months, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. As it currently looks like this:

But who knows, let's remain ~optimistic~!
