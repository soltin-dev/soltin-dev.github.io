My goal is to write an RPG adventure every month, to improve my writing and art skills. And today was my first deadline. This month I wanted to create an isometric dungeon, something I had not done before and was a great practice for both my art and layout skills. I am pretty happy with the end product, it is still rough and could use a lot more polishing. But I feel it is usable, and I am quite happy with some of the encounters. It is meant to be played with an OSR system like knave.

I will revisit it to redo it in the future, but for now I just had to complete it.

Next month I am planning to create a spy adventure, something with more of a narrative focus.
