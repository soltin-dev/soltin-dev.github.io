Today I send in my submission for the LÖVE game jam ***tetbridge***! I really wanted to join a jam and this one happened to line up well with my planning. Also the LOVE engine was a framework I happened to be interested in. Mostly due to the amazing branding and praise from people using it. During the jam I realised LUA is not for me. I can *somewhat* handle dynamically typed languages, but LUA truly brings the **worst** out of me when it comes to code quality. 

I like a functional approach to things, splitting everything up over multiple files where possible to keep everything local and *protected*, and for game engines I like an OO approach. While LUA technically allows for all of these it does not feel like the language guides you in that direction. In the end I still don't really understand how imports are meant to be used, I quickly defaulted to using global for some values because my project became unwieldy otherwise, and files and functions became a lot longer than I like.

I'm not sure how much of this was LUA's fault and how much was mine, but despite my grievances LUA delivered an end product. I sticked with it for the jam and created a "finished" product. I'm incredibly happy that I finished something, despite the ugly menus, little amount of levels and poor visual clarity it is a playable and all the base features are there.
I am considering porting it to a language I am more comfortable with, but for now I am just happy to have finished something. I really recommend joining a jam if you are a notorious project abandoner like I am.

Hopefully it is the first of many!
